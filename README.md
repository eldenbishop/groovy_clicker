# groovy_clicker
A simple groovy script for triggering mouse clicks.

This is meant to be run in groovyConsole.

On Apple OS/X, simply paste this script into GroovyConsole. With the groovyConsole application in the forground, position the mouse over the area on another window you would like to click and then press <command>-r to run the script. On OS/X, the clicks will occur without giving the target window focus. Simply keep hitting <command>-r which will click 100 times per invocation. If you want a different number of clicks, simply change the value in the script.
